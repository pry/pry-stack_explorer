pry-stack
===========

A Pry plugin to navigate the stack.

This gem is almost exactly the same as [pry-stack_explorer](http://github.com/pry/pry-stack_explorer), with three exceptions:

* Its name is shorter
* "up" and "down" actually move the stack pointer in those directions
* You can type "stack" instead of "show-stack"
* It has a fresh pine scent
