_Walk the stack in a Pry session_

pry-stack is a plugin for the [Pry](http://pry.github.com)
REPL that enables the user to navigate the call-stack.

From the point a Pry session is started, the user can move up the stack
through parent frames, examine state, and even evaluate code.

Unlike `ruby-debug`, pry-stack incurs no runtime cost and
enables navigation right up the call-stack to the birth of the
program.

pry-stack is currently designed to work on **Rubinius and MRI
Ruby 1.9.2+ (including 1.9.3)**. Support for other Ruby versions and
implementations is planned for the future.

The `up`, `down`, `frame` and `show-stack` commands are provided. See
Pry's in-session help for more information on any of these commands.

**How to use:**

After installing `pry-stack`, just start Pry as normal (typically via a `binding.pry`), the stack plugin will be detected and used automatically.

* Install the [gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/pry-stack): `gem install pry-stack`
* Read the [documentation](http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/pry-stack/master/file/README.md)
* See the [source code](http://github.com/epitron/pry-stack)
* See the [wiki](https://github.com/epitron/pry-stack/wiki) for in-depth usage information.

Example: Moving around between frames
--------

```
[8] pry(J)> show-stack

Showing all accessible frames in stack:
--
=> #0 [method]  c <Object#c()>
   #1 [block]   block in b <Object#b()>
   #2 [method]  b <Object#b()>
   #3 [method]  alphabet <Object#alphabet(y)>
   #4 [class]   <class:J>
   #5 [block]   block in <main>
   #6 [eval]    <main>
   #7 [top]     <main>
[9] pry(J)> frame 3

Frame number: 3/7
Frame type: method

From: /Users/john/ruby/projects/pry-stack/examples/example.rb @ line 10 in Object#alphabet:

     5:
     6: require 'pry-stack'
     7:
     8: def alphabet(y)
     9:   x = 20
 => 10:   b
    11: end
    12:
    13: def b
    14:   x = 30
    15:   proc {
[10] pry(J)> x
=> 20
```

Example: Modifying state in a caller
-------

```
Frame number: 0/3
Frame type: method

From: /Users/john/ruby/projects/pry-stack/examples/example2.rb @ line 15 in Object#beta:

    10:   beta
    11:   puts x
    12: end
    13:
    14: def beta
 => 15:   binding.pry
    16: end
    17:
    18: alpha
[1] pry(main)> show-stack

Showing all accessible frames in stack:
--
=> #0 [method]  beta <Object#beta()>
   #1 [method]  alpha <Object#alpha()>
   #2 [eval]    <main>
   #3 [top]     <main>
[2] pry(main)> up

Frame number: 1/3
Frame type: method

From: /Users/john/ruby/projects/pry-stack/examples/example2.rb @ line 10 in Object#alpha:

     5:
     6:
     7:
     8: def alpha
     9:   x = "hello"
 => 10:   beta
    11:   puts x
    12: end
    13:
    14: def beta
    15:   binding.pry
[3] pry(main)> x = "goodbye"
=> "goodbye"
[4] pry(main)> ^D

OUTPUT: goodbye
```

Output from above is `goodbye` as we changed the `x` local inside the `alpha` (caller) stack frame.

Limitations
-------------------------

* First release, so may have teething problems.
* Limited to Rubinius, and MRI 1.9.2+ at this stage.
